# Surreal Number

## Introduction 

This is a repository for a math concept: *the surreal number*.
The idea is from here: 
[matrix67 blog](http://www.matrix67.com/blog/archives/6333).

It won't include any proves. 
All the code published is verified by the tests in the project. 
However, bugs are inevitably included, so pull requests and issues from you are necessary.

Updating may be slow due to the position of the owner.
